Obesity levels 

Project Description:

Our project aims to classify individuals into seven obesity levels using lifestyle factors such as eating habits, physical activity, water intake, and smoking. In addition, we apply clustering techniques to discover hidden patterns in daily behaviors that may contribute to obesity.

Motivation:

We selected this dataset because obesity is a growing global health problem that causes both physical and mental challenges. By analyzing lifestyle habits, our study can provide useful insights for prevention and awareness, which may support healthier choices and reduce obesity-related risks.

Project Overview

The dataset contains 2111 rows and 17 columns, providing information about individuals’ lifestyle habits and health.

It includes numeric columns such as Age, Height, Weight, FCVC (daily vegetable consumption), NCP (number of high-calorie meals), FAF (physical activity days per week), and TUE (daily hours of physical activity).

The categorical columns include Gender, Family History of Obesity, FAVC (frequent high-calorie food), CAEC (eating while watching TV), SMOKE, SCC (snacking between meals), CALC (consumption of caloric drinks), and MTRANS (transportation method).

The target column, NObeyesdad, contains seven obesity levels: Insufficient_Weight, Normal_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III.
