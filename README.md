Obesity levels 

Project Description:

Our project aims to classify individuals into seven obesity levels using lifestyle factors such as eating habits, physical activity, water intake, and smoking. In addition, we apply clustering techniques to discover hidden patterns in daily behaviors that may contribute to obesity.

Motivation:

We selected this dataset because obesity is a growing global health problem that causes both physical and mental challenges. By analyzing lifestyle habits, our study can provide useful insights for prevention and awareness, which may support healthier choices and reduce obesity-relatedÂ risks.
