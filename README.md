# IT326-Obesity
Project Description:
Our project aims to classify individuals into 7 obesity levels 🧍🍔 using lifestyle factors such as eating habits 🥗, physical activity 🏃‍♀️, water intake 💧, and smoking 🚬. We also apply clustering 🔎 to discover hidden patterns in daily behaviors.

Motivation:
We chose this dataset because obesity is a major global health prevention, and analyzing these habits can provide useful insights 💡 for awareness and prevention.
